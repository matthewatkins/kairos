# Kairos Timekeeper Dashboard

🚨 NOTE: This project was built as a demonstration for a job interview process. It is not a production application.

[A hosted version of this can be found here](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/matthewatkins/kairos)

Kairos is an AI-enhanced timekeeping application that differentiates itself by using energy levels as its main mechanic rather than traditional clock-based time. In ancient Greek, Kairos means 'the right or critical moment'. Therefore, this app suggests the right task or activity at the right time based on a user's current energy level.

This project represents the **dashboard** component of what would be a larger application.

## Features

_All data is faked_

This dashboard includes:

- AI adapted context modes for showing appropriate tasks. These contexts are simplified down to "work" and "personal" modes.
- Context-Aware Time. Time display changes based on location, activity, and priorities. Shows current energy level with visual color indication.
  - In work context: shows project deadlines and meeting countdowns
  - In personal context: shows family events and personal goals
  - AI transitions between contexts automatically
- Suggested task list based on current energy level.
- Energy patterns
  - This includes a chart showing productivity cycles with day, week, and month views. These cycles are AI driven data assessed from actual patterns.
  - AI suggested times and scheduling based on user patterns and energy levels.
- Task list showing all current tasks based on the currently assessed context. Includes the ability to quickly add new tasks to that context.

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript
- Pinia for state management
- Vue Router for navigation
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.3 or higher for vue)
- npm (v7 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

To view the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── assets/        # Static assets
├── components/    # Reusable Vue components - mostly global UI components
├── features/      # App features including related types, stores, components, etc...
├── router/        # App routes
├── stores/        # Global Pinia stores
├── styles/        # Global styles and Tailwind CSS config
├── views/         # Page components
```

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use Pinia stores for state management
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Components that are specific to a feature should be
  included with the feature, not global components
- Use scoped styles for component-specific CSS
- Opt for Tailwind CSS over scoped styles
